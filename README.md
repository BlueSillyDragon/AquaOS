# SnowOS

SnowOS is a microkernel-based hobby operating system built from scratch in C++ targeted at the x86 architecture.

## How to Build and Run SnowOS

### Step 1: Clone repository

If you don't already have the source code, you'll have to clone it using the following commands:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/BlueSillyDragon/SnowOS.git
$ cd SnowOS
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

You'll need to install the needed tools to be able to build SnowOS if you don't have them installed already.
```
$ sudo apt install cmake clang ninja-build lld llvm
```
Also install qemu and ovmf for running SnowOS, you can skip this if you're going to use a different VM though (eg. VirtualBox)
> [!WARNING]
> I can't guarantee that SnowOS will run on VirtualBox, but feel free to try

### Step 3: Run get-deps

You'll need to get Yuki's dependencies by running get-deps
```
$ cd yuki
```
Then run get-deps
```
$ ./get-deps
```
This will get C and C++ freestanding headers, as well as limine.h for the kernel

### Step 4: Run CMake

First, you'll need to create a build dir, call it whatever you want, I'll call mine build here
```
$ mkdir build
```
cd into there, and then run the command for CMake below
```
$ cd build
$ cmake .. -GNinja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
```
Now you just have to run ninja
```
$ ninja
```

### Step 5: Run SnowOS

Now all you have to do is build the image file and run SnowOS under QEMU (or your VM of choice, just remember that you need to configure the VM settings to use UEFI).

Simply cd back into the root folder, and run image.sh
```
$ cd ../
$ ./image.sh
```
This should generate an image file called SnowOS.img, then you can just run it normallu (recommended command: qemu-system-x86_64 --enable-kvm -M q35 -m 4G -bios /usr/share/ovmf/OVMF.fd -serial stdio -hda SnowOS.img)

Now when you run SnowOS, you should be booted into the kernel.

## Technologies
Uses tinyubsan by rdmsr, Limine is the bootloader (will eventually swap back in with SnowBoot once I'm more confident in SnowBoot's abilities lol).

## License
SnowOS is under an GPLv3 License.
