limine-efi
==========

limine-efi is a fork of GNU-EFI that strips out all code save for
the relocation stubs and the EFI header files.

Additionally, it ships, in the "inc" directory, the ELF headers necessary
for the relocation code to build - along with fixes to the Makefile that
caused issues when using Clang, and a rework of the x86(_64) relocation
code.

For an example on how to use this, see:
